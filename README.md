# Feature-Engineering-in-High-Dimensional-Spaces
This project explores feature engineering techniques for high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy datasets, using the Golub ALL/AML gene expression dataset as a case study. The goal is to identify, reduce, and transform relevant features to improve machine learning model performance.
